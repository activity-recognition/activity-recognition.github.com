<p>An app to record, stream and label sensor data from the iPhone. It&#8217;s geared towards developers and researchers.</p>

<p>The app is written by Benjamin Thiel and started as a software project under my supervision building on previous tools we coded at the Embedded Systems Lab in Passau (yet, so far I did not contribute a single line of code to this new version ;)</p>
