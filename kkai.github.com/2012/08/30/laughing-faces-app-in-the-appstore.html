<p>Liquid error: No such file or directory - /Users/kkunze/Dropbox/action/web/_includes Over the last couple of weeks, I was getting settled in my new job. As I&#8217;m working with <a href='http://imlab.jp'>computer vision researchers</a> now, I started playing with the camera api for the iPhone.</p>

<p>Again, I&#8217;m very surprised by the accessibility and quality of Apples apis and their sample code.</p>

<p><img alt='Laughing Face' src='/imgs/laughing.png' /></p>

<p>As a start, this little app is a &#8220;privacy enhanced&#8221; camera app for entertainment purposes. It uses face detection and draws a little laughing face on top of each recognized head in real time. I hesitated putting it in the store, yet was asked by some friends to do so (had to exchange the laughing face due to copyright constraints).</p>

<p>Grab it while it&#8217;s hot &#8230; it&#8217;s quite popular in Japan (understandable given the background, see below), China and Saudi Arabia (of all places, &#8230; if somebody can tell me why, please send me a mail): <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/laughing-faces/id551656355?mt=8'>Laughing Faces AppStore Link</a></p>

<p>By the way, I had over 250 downloads the first day :) Oh if you wonder, the inspiration came from <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_Man_(Ghost_in_the_Shell'>Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex</a>)</p>

<p>If people bug me enough, I will make the png exchangable. Cannot tell you too much, yet expect an update when iOS6 hits.</p>
