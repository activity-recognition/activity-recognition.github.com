<p>This is a scratchpad &#8230; will fill the rest when I have time.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the work from Heng Liu, Tao Mei et. al. &#8220;Finding Perfect Rendezvous On the Go: Accurate Mobile Visual Localization and Its Applications to Routing&#8221;. They combine existing research in a very interesting mixture. They use a visual localization method based on <a href='http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/'>bundler</a> to detect where in the city a mobile phone user is. The application scenario I liked best was their collaborative localization for rendezvous :)</p>

<p>The best paper award went to Zhi Wang, Lifeng Sun, Xiangwen Chen, Wenwu Zhu, Jiangchuan Liu, Minghua Chen and Shiqiang Yang for &#8220;Propagation-Based Social-Aware Replication for Social Video Contents&#8221;. They use the contacts mined over social networking to replicate content for better streaming and content distribution. The presentation was great, the research solid, still it&#8217;s not a topic I&#8217;m very interested in. However, for content providers it seems very useful.</p>

<p>Shih-Yao Lin et. al. presented a system to recognize the users motion using the kinect and imitate them via a marionette in &#8220;Action Recognition for Human-Marionette Interaction&#8221;. I hoped to get more information about the interactions between users and marionettes, still very stylish presentation and artsy topic.</p>

<p>Hamdi Dibeklioglu et. al. showed how to infer the age of a person when they are simling in &#8220;A Smile Can Reveal Your Age: Enabling Facial Dynamics in Age Estimation&#8221;. I find fascinating to hear about small cues that can tell a lot about a person or a situation.</p>

<p>Fascinating work by Victoria Yanulevskaya et. al. (&#8220;In the Eye of the Beholder: Employing Statistical Analysis and Eye Tracking for Analyzing Abstract Paintings&#8221;). They link the emotional impact of a painting to the eye movements of the observer. Very interesting and in line with my current focus. I wonder if also expertise etc. can be recognized using sensors.</p>

<p>Another very art focused paper I enjoyed was &#8220;Dinner of LucieÃÅrnaga-An interactive Play with iPhone App in Theater&#8221; by Yu-Chuan Tseng. Theater visitors can interact with the play using their smart phone (getting also feedback on the device &#8230;.).</p>

<h2 id='posters_demos_competitions'>Posters, Demos, Competitions</h2>

<p>The winner of the Multimedia Grand Challenge was very well deserved. &#8220;Analysis of Dance Movements using Gaussian Processes&#8221; by Antoine Liutkus et. al. decomposed dance moves using Gaussian processes in movements with slow periodicity, high periodicity and moves that happened just once. Fascinating and applicable to so many fields &#8230; :)</p>

<p>A very neat demo was presented by Wei Zhang et. al.: &#8220;FashionAsk: Pushing Community Answers to Your Fingertips&#8221;.</p>

<h2 id='other_notes'>Other Notes</h2>

<p>As expected from any conference in Japan :), the organisation was flawless. In case any if the organisers is reading this. Thanks again. Nara is a perfect place for a venue like this (deer, world heritage sites, good food &#8230;).</p>

<p>More curiously, although there was a lot of talk about social media and some lively discussions on twitter, I seemed to be the only participant on <a href='https://alpha.app.net/'>ADN</a> at least posting with hashtag.</p>
