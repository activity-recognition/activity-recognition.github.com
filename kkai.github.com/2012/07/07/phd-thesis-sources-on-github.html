<p>Finished my phD. last year in Passau. The thesis is already published over <a href='http://www.opus-bayern.de/uni-passau/volltexte/2012/2611/'>Opus Bayern</a>. The pdf is open access, so feel free to read it (careful 19 MB pdf): <a href='http://www.opus-bayern.de/uni-passau/volltexte/2012/2611/pdf/kunze_kai.pdf'>Compensating for On-Body Placement Effects in Activity Recognition as pdf</a></p>

<p>However, the sources were not available. Finally, I got around to push the <a href='http://github.com/kkai/phdthesis'>latex sources of my dissertation</a> up to github.</p>
<hr />
<p>Please feel free to use it as a thesis template, attribution would be apprecitated ;)</p>
<hr />
<p>Please share if you make improvements, there are a lot of hacks and quick fixes in the sources.</p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;ll try to share most of the algorithms discussed in my dissertation.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick summary about the content:</p>

<p>This thesis investigates, how placement variations of electronic devices influence the possibility of using sensors integrated in those devices for context recognition. The vast majority of context recognition research assumes well defined, fixed sen- sor locations. Although this might be acceptable for some application domains (e.g. in an industrial setting), users, in general, will have a hard time coping with these limitations. If one needs to remember to carry dedicated sensors and to adjust their orientation from time to time, the activity recognition system is more distracting than helpful. How can we deal with device location and orientation changes to make context sensing mainstream? This thesis presents a systematic evaluation of device placement effects in context recognition.</p>
