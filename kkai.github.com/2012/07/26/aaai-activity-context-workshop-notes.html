<p>I enjoyed the AAAI context activity workshop a lot.</p>

<p>The keynote <a href='http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW12/paper/view/5292/5556'>How to make Face Recognition work (pdf)</a> by <a href='http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/akapoor/'>Ashis Kapoor</a> showed how to increase face recognition introducing very simple &#8220;context&#8221; constrains (two people in the same image cannot be the same person etc.). Very interesting work, I wonder how much better you can get introducing some more dynamic context recognition to the face recognition task.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphy/'>Gail Murphy</a> gave the other keynote <a href='http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW12/paper/view/5302/5557'>Task Context for Knowledge Workers (pdf)</a>. She introduces context modelling for tasks in GTD scenarios. Also quite interesting, as completely complimentary to my work (no mobile clients, sensors etc.).</p>

<p>A lot of people were aware of our efforts during the <a href='http://www.opportunity-project.eu/'>Opportunity Project</a> and the standard datasets we want to put out.</p>

<p>Rim Helaoui presented work about using <a href='http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW12/paper/view/5269/5552'>Probabilistic Description Logics (pdf)</a> for activity recognition, an interesting approach trying to combine data driven and rule-based activity inference. They used the opportunity dataset ;)</p>

<p>Bostjan Kaluza shared the call for more standardized datasets in context recognition in his talk about <a href='http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW12/paper/view/5305/5555'>The Activity Recognition Repository (pdf)</a>. A very important endeavor, I already also discussed several times. I think a broad effort in the field is necessary.</p>

<p>All the final papers are up on the <a href='http://activitycontext.org/final-papers/'>workshop website</a>.</p>
