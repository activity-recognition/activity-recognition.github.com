#Research Groups
[Computer Vision and Multimodal Computing](http://www.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/)
Perceptual Computing in general and Computer Vision in particular have great potentials to change the way we interact with computers and how machines such as robots perceive the world. Over the last three decades significant progress has been made in computer vision. Today it is possible to use image information for quality control and domain specific problems such as face recognition, recovery of CAD models for well-defined objects and basic visual surveillance. Robustness of perception and vision algorithms however is a notorious problem and one of the major bottlenecks for industrial applications. At the same time there is little doubt that in the next decades small and inexpensive sensors will be developed and embedded in many devices. Our hypothesis is that the integration of multiple features and sensors facilitates robustness in environments of realistic complexity. The Computer Vision and Multimodal Computing Department is headed by Prof. Dr. Bernt Schiele. Before coming to the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken he was head of the Multimodal Interactive Systems Group in Darmstadt.


[Embedded Intelligence](http://www.dfki.de/web/research/ei/index_html?set_language=en&cl=en)
Great progress in microelectronics, wireless communication and sensor technology afford the application of intelligent IT-systems and their cross-linking in every work and life area today. Products with new, integrated applications and functions can assist human in it’s activities and operations. Furthermore, the automated information exchange between intelligent, cross-linked systems allows the increase of productivity and the saving of ressources in production an work processes. The research of the group "embedded intelligence" focusses on the developement of innovative solutions in the field of cross-linked sensor-actuator-systems and energy-efficient systems.


[Teco](http://www.teco.edu/)
The TECO research group was founded in 1993 at the University of Karlsruhe (now KIT - Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) for R&D in applied telematics in close collaboration with the industry. Ubiquitous Computing is the cornerstone of work and competence, with Context-Sensitive Systems, HCI, Sensor/Actor Networks, Distributed Collaborative Systems, and Mobile Computing as current research foci. TECO is associated with the Pervasive Computing Systems group of the Institute of Telematics at the KIT but distinguishes itself in being close to industry both with respect to its funding model and its participation in "real-world projects" with a range of partners in the software and hardware industries.
